### About The App

Create your own playlists based off of your current mood! 
The app will have filters on the homepage for pre-selected moods which are something like

- Chill
- Pumped
- Angry
- Sleepy-Time

Users can click on their current mood and will then be taken to an index page containing songs filtered by mood. 
Users can then click on the songs they like to give them a listen.
When a user finds a song they want to keep, they click the 'Add to MoodList' button and that will add the song to their own personal playlist.
Users can click on the MoodList button to check out their personal playlist.
